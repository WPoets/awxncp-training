This chapter covers understanding services in the system

All the AwesomeEnterprise services are broken into various libraries
For example there is a library called env which allows you to work with the awesome envrionment

Service consists of 
a) Service name
b) 0 or more service attributes
c) optional Content


How to execute a Service
-----------------------

1:using a shortcode
----------------------
You can run a service using a shortcode

[str.create 'Vikas Kumar' /] 
will run the service str.create

a) Service name: str.create
b) 0 or more service attributes 
	main='Vikas Kumar'
	since unnamed attribute is given the name main

c) optional Content
	None

[content.run 
	when:@=int.is.odd when:main=int:5
]
	we are equal
[/content.run]

a) Service name: content.run
b) 0 or more service attributes 
	No service attributes. When: are processor attributes

c) optional Content

2:running dynamic services
---------------------------
Incase the name of the service is stored in a variable or you need to call a service dynamically u can use service.run

[env.set sname='str.create']
[service.run service='{env.sname}' main='Dynamic Service' /]

service.run takes all the service attributes and passes it further to the service
